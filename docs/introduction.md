# Introduction

## British Columbia Verifiable History (BCVH) Program

BCVH is the Province of British Columbia’s Web Verifiable History (WebVH) implementation, enabling government programs and partners to publish tamper-evident digital records. It supports verifiable credential ecosystems by providing a publicly accessible, hash-linked history of schemas, credential definitions, and revocation events authorized by the Province.

The program is administered by the BC Digital Trust team and aligns with provincial digital service standards. It draws inspiration from interprovincial governance work such as the ICDTC collaboration while focusing on BC’s policy, privacy, and Indigenous reconciliation commitments.

## Purpose of This Site

This site documents the governance framework for BCVH, covering:

- **Roles and policies** for Witnesses, Controllers, Watchers, and supporting stakeholders.
- **Operational practices** for running WebVH servers, handling changes, and responding to incidents.
- **Technical policies** that inform implementation decisions and ensure interoperability across participating services.
- **Glossary and appendices** to clarify terminology and provide quick reference material.

## Program Objectives

- Provide a trustworthy foundation for issuing and managing verifiable credentials across BC Government and affiliated partners.
- Honour privacy, reconciliation, and data sovereignty, recognizing the distinct rights of Indigenous Peoples.
- Promote interoperability with national and international digital trust ecosystems through open standards and aligned governance.
- Support digital service delivery by streamlining credential lifecycle management and auditable history publication.

## Governance Structure

- **BCVH Program Office:** Responsible for policy stewardship, onboarding approvals, and continuous improvement of the governance framework.
- **Witnesses:** Operated by delegated organizations to attest to events and anchor BCVH history.
- **Controllers:** Provincial entities authorized to publish schemas, issue credentials, and update revocation registries.
- **Watchers:** Independent observers who cache WebVH resources and provide transparency reporting.
- **Platform Partners:** Technical vendors and integrators who deliver supporting infrastructure, tooling, and applications.
