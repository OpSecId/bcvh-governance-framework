# BCVH Governance Framework Overview

## Introduction

The British Columbia Verifiable History (BCVH) Governance Framework defines how the Province operates its implementation of WebVH, ensuring a trusted verifiable data registry for digital interactions. Built on principles from the Trust Over IP governance metamodel and grounded in BC Government policy, the framework reflects contributions from the BCVH program office, provincial ministries, Indigenous partners, and platform integrators to ensure a shared understanding of how the network functions, evolves, and remains accountable.

## Purpose

The framework formalizes the principles, roles, and policies that allow the BCVH network to operate securely, transparently, and sustainably. It ensures that every governed participant understands how to onboard, act, and collaborate when writing or consuming transactions on the registry. It also supports stewardship of the verifiable data ecosystem by clarifying how decisions are made, who can authorize changes, and how compliance with provincial legislation and policy is maintained.

## Objectives

- Provide a governance model that enables BCVH to launch, grow, and admit new participants without compromising trust.
- Offer clarity on the responsibilities of Witnesses, Controllers, and Watchers within the WebVH ecosystem.
- Ensure transparent recordkeeping for attestations and network changes while respecting privacy and sovereignty.
- Maintain alignment with BC public sector mandates and Indigenous governance commitments while honouring the WebVH design principles.
- Encourage expansion of the ecosystem by publishing clear rules for onboarding technical integrators and public sector relying parties.

## Guiding Principles

### Shared Stewardship

Governance, operations, and usage of the BCVH verifiable data registry rely on collaborative decision-making. Participants agree to prioritize the network's collective interests while upholding the shared principles documented here.

### Jurisdictional Sovereignty

Although BCVH embraces shared decision-making, each participating organization retains authority within its legislated mandate. Policies in this framework are additive and do not supersede statutory obligations.

### Openness and Interoperability

Participants and integrators must employ open standards and open-source friendly tooling wherever practical. Implementations must avoid lock-in and support portability of credentials across ecosystems, ensuring that BCVH can interoperate with national and international networks.

### Accountability and Transparency

All governed roles are accountable to the BCVH program office and to the communities they serve. Activities such as attestations, configuration changes, and compliance reporting must be documented, discoverable, and auditable.

### Privacy and Minimal Disclosure

Network operations balance transparency with a commitment to privacy. Only the minimum information required to validate transactions appears on-ledger, and participants must apply privacy-by-design approaches in adjacent systems.

## Scope

The framework covers the governed role of Witness, supporting roles such as Controller and Watcher, and the interaction of technical integrators within the Province of British Columbia. It sets expectations for onboarding, day-to-day operations, and lifecycle management. Policies that individual ministries or agencies apply within their organizations—such as HR processes or detailed security procedures—remain out of scope but must align with applicable legislation and the principles laid out here.

## How to Use This Framework

- **Leaders and policymakers** can reference the framework when approving program agreements, funding requests, and risk mitigation plans.
- **Operational teams** can follow the role-specific policies to onboard staff, operate witness services, manage attestations, and run controller or watcher services.
- **Integrators and controllers** can consult the scope and appendices to understand technical prerequisites and compliance checkpoints before connecting to the network.
